# bitchat Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2025*

## Our Commitment

bitchat is designed with privacy as its foundation. We believe private communication is a fundamental human right. This policy explains how bitchat protects your privacy.

## Summary

- **No personal data collection** - We don't collect names, emails, or phone numbers
- **No servers** - Everything happens on your device and through peer-to-peer connections
- **No tracking** - We have no analytics, telemetry, or user tracking
- **Open source** - You can verify these claims by reading our code

## What Information bitchat Stores

### On Your Device Only

1. **Identity Key** 
   - A cryptographic key generated on first launch
   - Stored locally in your device's secure storage
   - Allows you to maintain "favorite" relationships across app restarts
   - Never leaves your device

2. **Nickname**
   - The display name you choose (or auto-generated)
   - Stored only on your device
   - Shared with peers you communicate with

3. **Message History** (if enabled)
   - When room owners enable retention, messages are saved locally
   - Stored encrypted on your device
   - You can delete this at any time

4. **Favorite Peers**
   - Public keys of peers you mark as favorites
   - Stored only on your device
   - Allows you to recognize these peers in future sessions

### Temporary Session Data

During each session, bitchat temporarily maintains:
- Active peer connections (forgotten when app closes)
- Routing information for message delivery
- Cached messages for offline peers (12 hours max)

## What Information is Shared

### With Other bitchat Users

When you use bitchat, nearby peers can see:
- Your chosen nickname
- Your ephemeral public key (changes each session)
- Messages you send to public rooms or directly to them
- Your approximate Bluetooth signal strength (for connection quality)

### With Room Members

When you join a password-protected room:
- Your messages are visible to others with the password
- Your nickname appears in the member list
- Room owners can see you've joined

## What We DON'T Do

bitchat **never**:
- Collects personal information
- Tracks your location
- Stores data on servers
- Shares data with third parties
- Uses analytics or telemetry
- Creates user profiles
- Requires registration

## Encryption

All private messages use end-to-end encryption:
- **X25519** for key exchange
- **AES-256-GCM** for message encryption
- **Ed25519** for digital signatures
- **Argon2id** for password-protected rooms

## Your Rights

You have complete control:
- **Delete Everything**: Triple-tap the logo to instantly wipe all data
- **Leave Anytime**: Close the app and your presence disappears
- **No Account**: Nothing to delete from servers because there are none
- **Portability**: Your data never leaves your device unless you export it

## Bluetooth & Permissions

bitchat requires Bluetooth permission to function:
- Used only for peer-to-peer communication
- No location data is accessed or stored
- Bluetooth is not used for tracking
- You can revoke this permission at any time in system settings

## Children's Privacy

bitchat does not knowingly collect information from children. The app has no age verification because it collects no personal information from anyone.

## Data Retention

- **Messages**: Deleted from memory when app closes (unless room retention is enabled)
- **Identity Key**: Persists until you delete the app
- **Favorites**: Persist until you remove them or delete the app
- **Everything Else**: Exists only during active sessions

## Security Measures

- All communication is encrypted
- No data transmitted to servers (there are none)
- Open source code for public audit
- Regular security updates
- Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy:
- The "Last updated" date will change
- The updated policy will be included in the app
- No retroactive changes can affect data (since we don't collect any)

Privacy isn't just a featureâ€”it's the entire point. bitchat proves that modern communication doesn't require surrendering your privacy. No accounts, no servers, no surveillance. Just people talking freely.
